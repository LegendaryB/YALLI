Yet another LoadLibrary injector. Nothing fancy, but here you go.
</div><br>

## üìù Usage

Reference the NuGet package in your application. After that you can use the library.

```csharp
// Injects into the first found notepad process
Injector.Inject("notepad", "C:\\Users\\LegendaryB\\Desktop\\Test.dll");

// Injects into the matching process
Injector.Inject("notepad", (processes) => {
	foreach (var process in processes) {
		if (process.MainModule.FileName.Contains("example")) {
			return process;
		}
	}

	return null;
},
"C:\\Users\\LegendaryB\\Desktop\\Test.dll");

// Injects into the process with the given id
Injector.Inject(3212, "C:\\Users\\LegendaryB\\Desktop\\Test.dll");

// Injects into the process referenced by the given process object
var process = Process.GetProcessesByName("notepad");
Injector.Inject(process[0], "C:\\Users\\LegendaryB\\Desktop\\Test.dll");
```

## üìù Usage of the console application

The console application uses the library under the hood to inject your dll into a target process. To do so just invoke the application like this:

```
YALLI.ConsoleApp.exe -pn processName -dll pathToDll
```
